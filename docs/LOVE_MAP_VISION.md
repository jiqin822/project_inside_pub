# Love Map — Level & Game Design Product Doc (Revised)

## Love Map Philosophy & Vision

### Philosophy (What we believe)
Love Map is built on a few core beliefs about intimate relationships:

1. **Closeness beats correctness**
   - Most relationship pain isn’t caused by “wrong logic,” but by feeling unseen, misunderstood, or alone.
   - The product should reward **understanding and repair**, not “winning.”

2. **Small moments compound**
   - Relationships change through tiny repeated interactions: a better response, a kinder assumption, a small bid for connection.
   - Love Map is designed for **daily micro-sessions** that compound into real closeness.

3. **Discovery should feel playful, not clinical**
   - Couples don’t want to fill out forms or do “therapy homework.”
   - Love Map reframes learning as **a game of clues, syncs, and surprises**—lightweight, fun, and emotionally safe.

4. **No shame, ever**
   - Not knowing something is normal. Getting it “wrong” should create curiosity, not embarrassment.
   - Love Map treats mismatch as **new information unlocked**, not failure.

5. **Depth must be earned and consented**
   - Vulnerability is precious and context-dependent.
   - Love Map escalates from casual to deep only when trust is present—and always with **agency, readiness, and privacy controls**.

6. **The relationship is the player**
   - The goal isn’t to “optimize” individuals. The goal is to grow the **relationship’s capabilities**: repair faster, appreciate more, understand better, stay close under stress.

---

### Vision (What Love Map becomes)
Love Map aims to become the **relationship’s living knowledge system**—a shared map of:
- what each person loves,
- what each person needs,
- what hurts,
- what heals,
- and what future they’re building together.

Over time, Love Map evolves into:
1. **A shared memory graph** (patterns, not just answers)
2. **A relationship skill builder** (repair, appreciation, support, alignment)
3. **A gentle co-pilot** (right prompt at the right time)
4. **A weekly clarity tool** (Relationship Radar: strengths, growth edges, next tiny step)

**Ultimate promise:**
> Love Map helps couples feel more understood, more supported, and more connected—without feeling like therapy, homework, or effort.

---

## 1. Purpose
Love Map is a **daily cooperative relationship game** that helps partners feel closer by turning small questions into **shared discoveries** and **collectible insights**—starting light and gradually going deeper, always with safety and agency.

Love Map is designed to:
- Build **accurate understanding** (“I know you”)
- Build **shared alignment** (“We sync”)
- Create **relationship improvements users can feel within 7 days**
- Drive **repeatable daily engagement** (60–90 seconds) without homework or shame

---

## 2. Core Experience Pillars
1. **Light first, deep later** (earned depth + explicit consent)
2. **No shame mechanics** (no “failure,” only discovery)
3. **Ultra-low friction** (fast inputs, no long forms)
4. **Co-op energy** (balanced participation; no one carries the load)
5. **Collectibles > grind** (insight cards as meaningful rewards)
6. **Actionable value** (weekly “Relationship Radar” shows concrete growth)
7. **Play together, live** (real-time co-op sessions add joy + momentum)

---

## 3. Primary Entry: “Today’s Need” (Job-to-be-done Front Door)
Users don’t show up to “level up”—they show up because they want something today.

### Today’s Need selector (1 tap)
- 🎉 **More Fun**
- 💛 **More Closeness**
- 🧘 **More Calm**
- 🛠 **Repair**
- 🌱 **Grow Us** (future/values)

This choice steers:
- Which region/tier to pull from
- The tone of questions
- Which insights to emphasize

**Default if users skip:** “More Closeness” (safe and broadly appealing)

---

## 4. Ways to Play

### 4.1 Solo-Asynchronous (Default)
Short daily sessions that each partner can do on their own time.
- “Drop a clue” → partner guesses later
- “Sync check” → both answer when they open the app

### 4.2 Real-Time Co-op (New Feature)
A live “play together now” experience that turns Love Map into a shared moment—like a mini party game for couples.

**Entry points**
- Button: **“Invite to play now”**
- Nudge: “Your partner is free—want a quick 2-minute round?”
- Scheduled routine (optional): “Daily Spark at 9pm”

**Session length**
- 2–5 minutes, designed for couch play

**Core principle**
- Mix question types so it never feels repetitive and always feels interactive.

---

## 5. Game Modes (Question Types)

### Type 1 — Preference Guess (Real-Time Know Me)
**Goal:** One user answers their preference; the other guesses **at the same time**; instant reveal.

**Flow (live)**
1. System shows a prompt to both players
2. One is designated as the “Answerer,” the other as the “Guesser”
3. Answerer picks their true option
4. Guesser picks what they think Answerer chose
5. Reveal immediately:
   - “You got it!” or “New info unlocked”
6. Award XP + create an Insight Card

**Key design notes**
- No pre-answer storage required
- Feels like a game show moment
- Great for Tier 1–3 and “Today’s Need: Fun/Closeness”

**Example prompts**
- “What dessert vibe are you craving most lately?”
- “When you’re stressed, what helps more: talk or space?”
- “Which feels more loving: words, acts, time, touch, gifts?”

---

### Type 2 — Sync Match (“Who is more…?”)
**Goal:** Both answer the same question independently; match yields a “sync spark.”

**Flow (live or async)**
1. Both answer simultaneously
2. Match → Sync XP
3. Mismatch → Discovery XP + compare view (optional)

**Example prompts**
- “Who’s more romantic?”
- “Who’s more likely to plan ahead?”
- “Who needs more alone time to recharge?”
- “Who apologizes first?”

**Key design notes**
- Always yields value (no “no score”)
- Great for warm-up and for couples who prefer low-disclosure prompts

---

## 6. Mixed Question Packs (Per Level + Category)
To keep play fresh, each tier/category uses **mixed question types** instead of a single mode.

### Pack structure
For any chosen Tier + Branch (e.g., Tier 2 → Stress & Comfort):
- 40–60% Type 1 (Preference Guess)
- 40–60% Type 2 (Sync Match)
Adjust based on “Today’s Need” and readiness.

### Why mixed packs work
- Prevents monotony (“always guessing,” “always matching”)
- Balances disclosure and fun
- Reduces “questionnaire feel”
- Creates more replay variety

---

## 7. Daily Session Design (60–90 seconds) — “Today’s Spark”
One big card with:
- **Quick Solo Round** (async)
- **Invite to Play Now** (real-time co-op)

### Recommended daily structure
- Solo: **1 question** (Type 1 or Type 2)
- Live: **3 questions** (mixed pack)

### No backlog rule (anti-homework)
- No lists of unanswered prompts.
- “Save for later” capped (e.g., 3 max).
- If not used, prompts gracefully rotate out.

---

## 8. Participation Balance (Fixing Asymmetry Chore Risk)
Asymmetry can become work if one person always answers preferences or “drops clues.”

### Balancing mechanics
- **Auto-rotation:** Answerer/Guesser rotates each round
- **Equalizer:** If one partner has answered more in the week, system assigns roles to balance
- **Low-effort options:** “Pick one statement that fits today” / “Pick a vibe only”

### Confirm vs Create (reduces friction)
Instead of always new questions:
- “Still true today?” confirmation prompts
This keeps the experience light and prevents fatigue.

---

## 9. World Map Level Design (Progression as Exploration)
Love Map is a map with regions. Each region has branches (paths) and nodes (question templates).
Depth is framed as exploration:
> “Explore new regions together”  
not “Answer deeper questions.”

### Regions (Tiers)
1. **Tier 1 — Sparks** (playful identity)
2. **Tier 2 — Rhythms** (daily life + stress basics)
3. **Tier 3 — Connection Skills** (love signals + conflict + respect)
4. **Tier 4 — Roots** (history + triggers + trust)
5. **Tier 5 — Depth** (vulnerability + meaning + future)

### Seasonal & Weekly Arcs (prevents novelty fade)
- Weekly themes: “Comfort Week,” “Adventure Week,” “Appreciation Week”
- Seasonal collections: “Winter Cozy Map,” “Summer Play Map”

---

## 10. Skill Tree Design (Casual → Deep, Still Interesting)
Each tier contains 2–4 branches; each branch has 5–8 nodes.
Each node is a question template playable as mixed packs of Type 1 + Type 2.

---

## 11. Safety & Consent (Deep Content Buffering)
### Readiness check (1 tap)
Before deeper content, ask:
- “Today feels: **Light / Normal / Tender**”

If “Tender”:
- default to Tier 1–3 or “private reflection first”
- avoid sensitive prompts

### Private-first option (reduces risk)
For vulnerable prompts:
1. User answers privately
2. App asks: “Share with partner?” (Yes / Not today)
3. If not shared, still gives personal insight and optional gentle action

### Visibility controls
For sensitive insights:
- Share
- Keep private
- Share summary only

---

## 12. Personalization System (Questions Feel “About Us”)
### Personalization inputs
- User portrait (preferences, patterns)
- Dyad portrait (knowledge gaps, mismatch history)
- Recent context (mood/stress, opt-in)

### Rules
- Prefer unknown/low-confidence areas
- Avoid repetition (rotate format + phrasing)
- Calibrate depth to consent + readiness
- Use mismatch history for gentle follow-ups
- Keep sessions short; select highest-ROI prompts

---

## 13. Scoring & Rewards (No Shame, High Return)

### XP (background)
Users primarily see:
- Map fill %
- Tier unlocks
- Collections completed

**Principles**
- Type 1 correct guess: meaningful XP
- Type 1 wrong guess: Discovery XP for viewing reveal
- Type 2 match: Sync XP
- Type 2 mismatch: Discovery XP for comparing views
- Deeper tiers: higher XP (but always gated by consent/readiness)

### Collectibles (primary motivator)
- Insight Cards
- Cheat Sheets
- Inside Joke Cards
- Milestone Badges

### Streaks (non-punitive)
- “Keep the flame alive”
- “Streak protection” tokens

---

## 14. Relationship Radar (Weekly Value Anchor)
A weekly recap that makes the app feel useful:
- “You’re strongest at: **Fun**”
- “Growth edge: **Stress Support**”
- “One tiny suggestion: **Try 1 comfort prompt + 1 appreciation action**”
- “New cards unlocked this week: 4”

---

## 15. Voucher/Bounty Integration (Optional, Non-Gross)

### Voucher as Hint Tokens (game power-ups)
Users can spend vouchers/currency on:
- Narrow options to 2
- Reveal category preference
- Reveal last similar answer
- Reveal one clue word

**Rule:** Hints never block emotional progress; they only enhance gameplay.

### Suggested acts (soft, optional)
From insights, the system can suggest (1 tap):
- Offer voucher idea (acts of service, quality time)
- Request bounty idea (support ask)

Never required for leveling.
