Here’s a Love Map skill tree that’s explicitly built around the question types you listed, and progresses from casual/light → deep, while still feeling like a fun co-op game.

Design idea: Love Map is a tree of “Knowledge Skills” your relationship unlocks by answering the right kinds of questions at the right depth.

Love Map Skill Tree: Casual → Deep
Tree Structure

You have 6 tiers (depth levels). Each tier contains branches (question families). Each branch unlocks:

new question sets

“insight cards” (summaries)

optional hint tokens (for the economy integration)

Depth gating (soft)

Tier unlocks when you hit coverage thresholds (e.g., “answered 8/12 in Tier 1”) + a comfort signal (no negative reaction patterns / explicit “too deep” flags).

**Purpose

Love Map as a Card Deck With Milestones
Core UX
Each day (or session) users open Love Map Deck and see:


1–3 cards (quick)


Mix of:


1 light/fun or practical


1 support/appreciation


occasional repair/vulnerability only when ready




Each card is one “moment of discovery.”

1) Deck Structure
Deck = Layers → Subdecks → Cards


6 Layers (depth)


Each Layer has subdecks (themes)


Each subdeck contains cards (questions, mini-games, reflections)


6 Main Layers (in card form)


🍿 Vibes & Tastes


🧩 Daily Life & Logistics


🧠 Inner Operating System


💛 Appreciation & Connection


🧱 Triggers & Repair


🫀 Vulnerability & Meaning


(Optionally 7) 🌅 Future & Shared Story

2) Card Types (the “game pieces”)
You’ll want 5 core card types that map to your question types.
A) Quick Pick Cards (Casual)


10–20 seconds


Multiple choice / swipe


Great for early layers


Example:
“Pick your ideal Saturday:
☀️ brunch + walk / 🎮 stay in / 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 friends / 🛌 recharge”
Rewards:


small XP


adds preference to portrait



B) Guess-My-Answer Cards (Predictive / gamified)
User guesses partner’s answer first → then partner reveals actual.
Rewards:


Understanding XP boosted by correctness


Creates “I know you” feeling


Example:
“How do you think I prefer comfort when stressed?
A) advice B) hug C) space D) distraction”

C) Support Cards (Operating System)
Single answer + “what helps / what hurts”
Example:
“When I’m overwhelmed, the most helpful thing you can do is ___.”
Output:


“Support Protocol” snippet stored in portrait



D) Repair Cards (Trigger / boundary)
Softer framing. Not accusatory.
Example:
“One thing that makes me shut down fast is ____ (choose 1–2).”
Output:


“Avoid list” + “repair plan” building blocks



E) Vulnerability Cards (Deep)
Two-step by default:


private reflection


share (optional)


Example:
“A fear I don’t always say out loud in relationships is ___.”
Output:


intimacy map / reassurance preferences



3) Milestones (progress that feels meaningful)
Milestones are the “level design” equivalent: players feel momentum and unlocks.
Milestone Types
✅ Coverage Milestones (Knowledge Completion)


“You’ve mapped 10 preferences”


“You’ve mapped 5 stress supports”


“You’ve mapped 3 repair moves”


✅ Accuracy Milestones (Understanding)
Based on Guess-My-Answer correctness:


“Mind Reader I: 60% accuracy across 10 guesses”


“Mind Reader II: 75% across 20 guesses”


✅ Reciprocity Milestones (Mutuality)
Ensures it’s not one-sided:


“Both partners shared 5 cards this week”


“Both answered 3 deeper cards”


✅ Safety Milestones (Readiness)
Unlock deeper layers only when safety is built:


consistent participation


low conflict intensity markers


positive interaction ratio


(If you track “repair success” or “tone,” it can help gate deeper decks.)

4) Milestone Unlocks (what users get)
Milestones should unlock new content + real utility:
Unlock A: New Subdeck
“Appreciation: Micro-actions” deck unlocked
Unlock B: Insight Cards (auto-generated)
A shareable, cute summary card:


“When I’m stressed: I want quiet + physical comfort + no advice.”


Unlock C: “Hint Tokens” (your voucher integration)
Earned at milestones; spent on:


reveal partner’s answer history


get “2 hints” for a tough Guess card


unlock an “easier version” of a deep card


Unlock D: Auto-suggestions (optional, not forced)
Based on Love Map knowledge, system suggests:


a voucher you could offer


a bounty you might request


But the Love Map doesn’t require action.

5) Personalized Question Generation (Card Selection Logic)
Inputs


User portrait (preferences, style)


Dyad portrait (gaps, mismatches)


Recent events (stress, conflict, good moments)


Engagement history (which cards they skip/like)


Current layer readiness


Daily Card Mix Algorithm (simple + effective)
When user opens Love Map:


Always include 1 easy win (Quick Pick or light Guess)


Include 1 growth card (Support/Appreciation/Repair)


Include 1 optional wildcard (Deep card only if “ready”)


Readiness gating


Deep decks require:


prior milestones completed


consent (“Want to go deeper today?”)


skip does not penalize





6) The Card UX (interaction design)
Each card has the same structure so it’s learnable:
Front


Title (cute)


Question


“Why this matters” (1 line, optional)


Answer UI (choices / text / slider)


After answer


If predictive: show “You guessed X, actual was Y”


Show reward:


+XP


+Milestone progress




Show “Saved to Love Map” as a badge


Optional “Use this”


“Create a voucher suggestion”


“Create a bounty suggestion”


“Save as a comfort tip”


This is where activities/vouchers appear naturally.

7) Vouchers & Bounties (Natural, Non-forced Integration)
A) Love Map → Voucher Suggestions
When Love Map learns something actionable, it can suggest:
Examples:


If partner loves acts of service → “Offer: laundry help voucher”


If partner stressed frequently → “Offer: 10-min decompress time voucher”


If partner values words → “Offer: appreciation message voucher”


UX: after a relevant card:
“Want to turn this into a voucher?” (one tap)

B) Love Map → Bounty Suggestions
If user expresses need, app can suggest a bounty:
Examples:


“Request: quiet time together”


“Request: help cooking tonight”


“Request: reassurance check-in”


UX: “Make a request” button appears when it fits.

C) Voucher System → Love Map Hint Tokens
This is the cleanest direct bridge:


Earn “Hint Tokens” through:


partner giving voucher


completing a bounty


positive streaks / milestones




Spend tokens inside Love Map:


“Reveal 2 hints”


“Show partner’s previous answer”


“Skip + redraw (no penalty)”




This makes vouchers feel like “support fuel” for discovery.

8) Concrete Milestone Ladder (Example)
Milestone Set for Layer 1 (Vibes & Tastes)


“First 10 Cards” (unlock: Guess deck)


“3 Correct Guesses” (unlock: mini insight card)


Layer 2 (Daily Life)


“Mapped our routines” (unlock: Support deck)


“Found 2 friction points” (unlock: gentle repair prompts)


Layer 3 (Operating System)


“Support Protocol v1 created” (unlock: Appreciation deck)


Layer 4 (Appreciation)


“3 Appreciation patterns learned” (unlock: Voucher suggestions)


Layer 5 (Repair)


“Repair Kit v1 created” (unlock: deeper vulnerability prompts)


Layer 6 (Vulnerability)


“Safety Pact created” (unlock: Future deck)



9) Your “Deck Screen” Layout (high-level)


Top: Milestone bar


“Layer 2: Daily Life — 60%”




Middle: Today’s 3 cards


Bottom: Subdeck selector


“Fun / Practical / Support / Repair / Deep (locked/unlocked)”




Side: Hint token counter


Optional: “Insight Library” (collected cards)



If you want one step more implementation-ready
I can output:


a JSON schema for decks/cards/milestones


a card selection algorithm (pseudo-code)


example card templates per layer (20–30 cards each)


Pick one:


JSON schema + selection logic (most useful for engineering)


Sample card library (most useful for content)
